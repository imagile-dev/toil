description: Rules for toil's GitHub Pages site under site/ (Astro), and for the brand it shares with the terminal welcome screen in src/welcome/ and Toil UI's header. Use when changing any page, component, style, colour token, the logo or its animation, the wordmark or its font, data file (the Connect catalogue, the docs path, principles), generated art, when adding or updating an integration's docs page, when touching the terminal splash, menu palette or logo in src/welcome/, or when taking the desktop and 375px screenshots a site PR needs.

# Site

`site/` is an Astro site deployed to https://imagile-dev.github.io/toil/ by
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` (it builds on every PR that touches `site/` and deploys
from `main`).

- **Always mobile responsive.** The site is read wherever a shared link lands, and
  that is often a phone, so a page that only works on a desktop isn't finished, the
  same way *principle 8* treats platforms. Every page and component works from 320px
  up with a 16px side gutter: nothing scrolls sideways, text stays readable without
  zooming, standalone tap targets (buttons, nav and footer links, "see all" links; not
  links inside a sentence) are at least 44px tall, and multi-column layouts collapse to one
  column. Wide content (code, tables) scrolls inside its own container, never the
  page. Grid children get `min-width: 0` so one long line can't widen the layout.
  A page's frame comes from the layout tokens in `global.css` (#459): `--gutter`
  for the side gutter (16px on a phone, up to 48px), `--section-space` and
  `--section-space-tight` for a section's padding, all scaling with the viewport,
  never a fixed desktop size on a phone.
- **Dark only, in Plain's blue** (#442). It uses the Imagile design system's bones
  (type, grid, spacing, drafting-style iconography) in Toil UI Plain's dark
  scheme: one hue, the blue accent (`#8cc4ff`), with a lighter tint of it
  (`--color-highlight`) for values, "live" states and small highlights, and the two
  as the accent gradient. Plain's own colours (bg, surfaces, ink, muted, line,
  accent and its ink, focus, ok, warn, danger) aren't written by hand:
  `site/scripts/plain-tokens.mjs` writes them from `ui/themes/plain/theme.json`
  into `site/src/styles/plain.generated.css` before every `dev` and `build`, and
  `site/src/styles/global.css` imports that and derives the other roles from it.
  Change the theme, never the generated file; `test/brand-sync.test.ts` fails when
  it has drifted. ok, warn and danger are for status only (a stable level, a sent
  form), never decoration; no other hue appears, in the site or in generated art.
  No light palette, no theme toggle. Toil UI's showcase (`/ui/`) keeps each theme's
  own colours inside its frame. The feedback emails wear Plain too (#453): light
  inline, Plain's dark scheme for clients that ask, from a hand copy in
  `functions/feedback/src/lib/palette.ts` that `test/brand-sync.test.ts` holds to
  the theme. A change to Plain's colours changes that copy in the same PR.
- **Imagile is credited prominently**: a byline in the header, a linked "By Imagile"
  in the hero eyebrow, and a feature panel in the footer, all pointing to
  https://www.imagile.dev. Imagile's mark appears only in the footer panel, drawn
  in one colour from the tokens (`ImagileMark.astro`, #468), never its terracotta;
  the header byline is text alone, since the mark is too small to read there (#473).
- **Honest about status** (*principle 4*). Until 1.0, the site says **Alpha**
  ("Alpha: APIs and flags may change before 1.0", the README's wording) by the
  install commands and in the hero, and labels sample output as planned. The
  homepage's two ways to start come from `site/src/data/start.json`, copied from the
  README; `test/start-commands.test.ts` fails when they drift. An integration is on the board
  only once its code is on `main`, and shows its verification level: `unit`,
  `live` or `stable` (**Verification Levels**, `integrations` skill). Their
  meanings are rendered from `site/src/data/levels.json`, never written out in a
  page.
- **The docs are the toil skill, rendered.** `skills/toil/*.md` is the one copy of
  the reference: every page under `site/src/pages/docs/` and `site/src/pages/connect/`
  but `/docs/welcome/`, `/docs/ui/` (`ui/README.md`), `/docs/themes/`
  (`ui/docs/themes.md`), `/docs/ui-help/` (`ui/docs/help.md`), `/docs/commands/`
  (the registry's lists) and the `/connect/` catalogue renders
  one of its files through `src/components/SkillPage.astro`, the file's own heading
  and description become the hero, and inline `<file>.md` references become links
  (`src/lib/skill-pages.mjs`, a remark plugin in `astro.config.mjs`). A page adds
  only facts and generated lists: the board entry's status and credential, and
  "at a glance" lists of commands and settings from `site/src/data/commands/<area>.json`
  and `site/src/data/settings/<area>.json`, which `test/site-commands.test.ts` writes
  from the registry (run `npx vitest run -u` in the root; never edit them by hand).
  `test/site-docs.test.ts` fails on a page with a run of literal text longer than a
  label, so reference prose goes in the skill file, never in a template.
- **One source per fact.** Each integration's board entry is its own file,
  `site/src/data/integrations/<area>.json` (status, credential, supported version);
  `site/src/data/integrations.ts` gathers them and `docs/integrations.md` points at
  them; `site/src/data/principles.ts` restates the **Principles** in CLAUDE.md for
  users and keeps their numbering.
- **Motion everywhere, never required.** Every animation sits behind
  `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, and scroll reveals only hide content after
  `motion.js` has armed them, so with no JS or reduced motion everything is visible.
  A hero's headline, lead and call to action are never hidden behind an entrance
  animation, even for a moment: they may rise into place, but never fade in (#459).
  A reveal never clips the observed element itself (a fully clipped element never
  intersects, and a lazy image inside it never loads); clip its children.
- **House style has three registers; pick by job, never mix them in one image.**
  - *The mark* is toil's logo: the badge, Toil UI Plain's dark badge (#442). A
    flat tile in the accent blue whose top-right corner is cut on the diagonal,
    parallel to the fold of the page it holds, and on that page, in the accent's
    dark ink (10.2:1 on the tile), a light fold and `>` in ink (15.5:1) and the
    cursor in the accent (10.2:1). No gradient. The cut corner and the dog-eared
    page are what make it toil's: the `>_` alone is everyone's (macOS Terminal,
    Windows Terminal, Lucide's square-terminal), so the page always keeps its fold
    and its cut corner, never a plain dark square. It's flat, symbolic, serious, and
    hand-built SVG: the component is `site/src/components/Logo.astro`, the static
    copies are `public/favicon.svg` and `public/brand/toil-avatar.svg` (the badge on
    a near-black disc, circular with transparent corners, exported to 512 and 256
    PNG; Discord's posts use the 512, see the `automation` skill). All of them share
    one geometry; change them together. It never comes from an image model, and has
    no characters and no jokes. **Never add a spark, starburst or sparkle to it**, in
    any theme or any size: an agent CLI with a burst is another product's mark. Sizes: 34px in the header, 26px in the footer, and 192px at most
    anywhere else.
  - *Its motion is a cursor blink.* The cursor blinks three times on load and again
    when the pointer or focus reaches the link around it, then stays lit, so it
    never blinks for five seconds (WCAG 2.2.2). It's pure CSS, behind
    `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.
  - *The terminal draws the badge in orbit.* Bare `toil` opens a splash
    (`src/welcome/logo.ts`) that draws the badge, shrunk, on a braille canvas with
    six tool dots (highlight, accent, ink, repeating) on an implied ring around it: the
    badge fades in, the dots pop on, the cursor blinks twice, the ring turns half a
    revolution and settles on the picture it left. Its still copy is
    `public/brand/toil-orbit.svg`, for docs. On the braille canvas the dark page is
    the terminal's own background: only the tile, the fold and the prompt are
    drawn. The menu wears a Toil UI theme's terminal version
    (`src/welcome/themes/`, #427), whose colours come from its `theme.json` and are
    held there by `test/theme-sync.test.ts`. Crate is the default in the terminal
    and in Toil UI alike (#467, one constant in `src/theme/default.ts`), and
    `toil theme set` picks another. Crate wears the site's blue (#472), so on a
    dark terminal the default menu is the site's palette, as Plain's is, but for
    `faint`, which is lifted so it reads on lighter dark terminals too (#471). On a
    light terminal the page is white, which is Plain's light badge. Every theme's
    colours meet 4.5:1 on light grounds down to `LIGHT_GROUND` and dark ones up to
    `DARK_GROUND` (`src/welcome/themes/index.ts`), and the hidden game draws in the
    same palette, so it follows the theme too. Each theme keeps the badge and changes
    only what surrounds it (the orbit for Plain and Crate, crops, warp, embers,
    rain, steam or fairies), never the mark itself. **The site, the terminal and
    Toil UI are one brand in the mark and the wordmark: a change to the badge's
    geometry changes all three in the same PR.** The palette is shared
    between the site, the feedback emails, Toil UI Plain and Crate: a change to
    Plain's colours changes the site's tokens, the emails' copy and Crate's
    `theme.json` (and its terminal version) in the same PR.
    `test/brand-sync.test.ts` fails when the site's tokens or the emails' colours
    differ from Plain's `theme.json`, when a colour in Crate's `theme.json` isn't
    the site's token for its role, when Crate's art strays from the blue palette, or when the terminal's tile, page placement or
    orbit, or any static copy of the badge, differs from the site's. It can't see
    the motion, so a change to it is mirrored by hand.
  - *Toil UI wears the badge in every theme.* A theme that brings none (one from
    the user's folder) shows the standard badge (`ui/src/mark.svg`). Plain's is the
    same badge in Plain's own blue, one per scheme (the tile takes that scheme's
    `accent`, with a white or dark page; `assets/mark-light.svg` and
    `mark-dark.svg`); the dark one is the site's badge and the standard one, line
    for line. Each built-in game theme
    has its own skin of the same silhouette in `ui/themes/<theme>/assets/mark.svg`: Crate
    blue-grey cardboard with a hazard-striped tape in the highlight and a stencilled prompt, Harvest a
    16-pixel wooden sign, Starship a riveted hull plate with a glowing console, Realm
    an illuminated tile with a gilt edge, Frontier a riveted brass boiler plate
    with a copper rule, Overworld a mossy dungeon block with a torch-gold rim. It sits beside the name at 32px (twice
    Harvest's grid), and it is the tab's icon too (`ui/src/favicon.ts` swaps it with
    the theme). A new theme's mark keeps the tile's silhouette and a prompt at 4.5:1
    on what it sits on; the test holds the tile's path in every skin.
  - *The wordmark* is the word "toil" in Fredoka 600 (`--font-brand`, the class
    `.wordmark`): the site's header and footer, and Toil UI's header in every theme,
    where "UI" is a die-cut sticker stuck on beside it, so the word itself never
    changes. It's real type, never an image, and only the word "toil" uses it;
    headings and the hero keep their faces. Only the Latin 600 file is imported.
    The terminal draws the same word from the face itself: `scripts/gen-wordmark.mjs`
    rasterises Fredoka 600 in headless Chrome onto quadrant blocks (two pixels across
    and two down per cell, sampled twice as densely across because a cell is twice
    as tall as it is wide) and writes `src/welcome/wordmark.ts`; hand-tuning goes in
    the script's `TUNE`, never in the data. It's 8 lines by 33 columns, shaded from
    the accent at the baseline to the highlight at the top, over a one-cell shadow
    in a dark blue (colour only), with a cursor after it that blinks with the badge's. The splash
    and the menu draw it at that one size, never stretched for a wide window, so it
    sits beside the logo at 80 columns. A change to the face
    changes all three in the same PR; `test/brand-sync.test.ts` holds the site's and
    the UI's token, weight and version together. Both favicons are the badge.
  - *Diagrams* are precise drafting-style line drawings for how-it-works art (the
    hero), generated with `.claude/image-generation/style.md`.
  - *Cartoons* are lighthearted spot illustrations, generated with
    `.claude/image-generation/style-cartoon.md` (pass `--style-file`). The recurring
    character is the crate, a blue package box in a hard hat. The crate is
    always competent; the joke is on the bureaucracy around it, never on users or
    their employers.
- **Generated art** sits on the deep ground `#0a0c0f` (`--color-bg-deep`, or
  darker), at or below every surface it's shown on, and shows with
  `mix-blend-mode: lighten` on its wrapper, so the grid shows through. The art
  made before #442 was recoloured from its warm originals pixel for pixel (warm
  hues into the blue band, warm greys to cool, the ground pulled under the deep
  ground), so the drawings are unchanged; new art uses the style files' blue
  palette. Ship WebP at
  960 and 1536 wide; the PNG masters stay in the ignored run folders. Every cartoon
  gets real alt text describing the joke.
- **Documentation has two levels:**
  - **How it works** (`/about/how-it-works/`) is the high-level picture: the one-core
    design, output, configuration, credentials, safety, MCP and installation. It
    changes only when the big picture does.
  - **The docs** (`/docs/`) are the detail: `SKILL.md` as the index, `core.md`,
    `dossiers.md`, `install.md`, `mcp.md`, `util.md`, `skills.md`, Toil UI's own
    docs and a command index (`/docs/commands/`, the registry's lists). They are
    read as a path, Get started, Use, Connect, Agents, Toil UI, Reference, which
    `site/src/data/docs-path.mjs` defines once: the index draws it, the footer
    links its groups, and every docs page takes its breadcrumb and its previous
    and next links from it. A new docs page goes on the path there.
  - **Connect** (`/connect/`) is the catalogue of everything toil talks to: the
    integration areas by category (each board file's `group`) and the database
    engines (`site/src/data/databases.json`, written by `test/site-commands.test.ts`
    from the providers, with each engine's sign-in in `site/src/data/db-sign-in.json`),
    each with its level and sign-in. `db.md` is `/connect/db/`, and each area file
    is `/connect/<area>/`, generated by `src/pages/connect/[area].astro` from the
    files themselves. A new area's file is its page with no page code, and the
    test fails when a board entry has no file, so each tile links to a page.
    Nothing lists what toil won't integrate.
  - **About** (`/about/`) holds How it works, the principles, the changelog
    (`CHANGELOG.md`, rendered) and the feedback form, and the case for toil that
    no longer fits on the homepage. **The homepage stays at five sections**: the
    hero, which is the toil map, Get started, Connect, Toil UI and the
    principles. Something added there means something comes off (principle 11).
    Get started opens with the start-here paths by role (#433), `startPaths` in
    `docs-path.mjs`: three steps each, every one a page or heading already on the
    docs path, never a page of its own.
  - **Search** (#433) is the header's Search button, `/` or Ctrl+K (Cmd+K): a
    `<dialog>` (`src/components/SiteSearch.astro`, `src/scripts/search.ts`) over one
    static index, `dist/search.json`, which `scripts/search-index.mjs` writes after
    `astro build` from the built pages' titles and headings and the registry's lists
    in `src/data/` (`src/lib/search.mjs`). Nothing in it is written by hand, nothing
    is fetched from anywhere else, and `check-links.mjs` fails on a result that
    doesn't land. A new page or heading is searchable with no change here; mark a
    part of a heading that isn't its name (a count) `data-search-skip`. The dev
    server has no index: search on `npm run build` and `npm run preview`.
  - **Moving a page leaves its old address forwarding.** GitHub Pages can't
    redirect, so `site/src/pages/[...old].astro` builds a page at each old address
    in `src/lib/redirects.mjs` that forwards with its query and hash, and the
    sitemap leaves them out. `npm run build` ends with `scripts/check-links.mjs`,
    which fails on an internal link or anchor that doesn't resolve, on a page
    linking to an old address, on an old address that forwards nowhere, and on a
    page under `/connect/` with no node on `/map/`.
  - **The toil map** (`src/components/ToilMap.astro`, #432) is the homepage's hero
    and, larger, `/map/`: who asks (agents, people, CI/CD), toil, and everything
    it reaches. Its nodes come from `src/data/map.ts`, which reads the Connect
    catalogue, so a new board file is a new node with no map edit. Hover, focus
    or a first tap lights a node's paths and shows its label; the wires and
    motion are `src/scripts/toil-map.js`, and the map works without them. It
    uses the site's colour tokens only, never a colour of its own.
  - **Diagrams in the docs** are hand-drawn HTML and inline SVG in
    `site/src/figures/<name>.html`, never a runtime library or CDN. A skill file
    places one with a `<!-- figure: <name> -->` line, which agents read past and the
    remark plugin in `src/lib/skill-pages.mjs` swaps for the figure (`{base}` in it
    becomes the site's base path). The prose around it says the same thing in
    words. Each is a `<figure>` with a caption, an SVG has a `<title>` and `<desc>`,
    a drawing too wide for a phone has a second, tall variant, and scrolling code
    is `tabindex="0"` with a label; `test/site-docs.test.ts` checks all of it. The
    figures' styles live in the page that renders the file
    (`src/pages/docs/dossiers.astro`). Toil UI's own docs, `ui/docs/*.md`
    (`/docs/themes/`, `/docs/ui-help/`), place figures the same way, and `UI_DOC_PAGES` in
    `skill-pages.mjs` names each one's page.
- **Toil UI's help links land on real headings.** Every Read more link in Toil UI is a
  page and heading id in `ui/src/help.ts`; `npm run build` ends with
  `scripts/check-help-links.mjs`, which fails when one isn't in the built pages, so a
  renamed heading in a docs page that Toil UI links to updates its topic in the same PR. The dev server keeps a figure's old
    markup until it restarts.
- **Every new or changed integration reviews its skill file, which is its docs
  page, in the same PR**: setup, credential and where to create it, config keys,
  commands, verification level. Add a `credentialWhere` entry only when the menu path is certain; a wrong
  path costs users more than a generic one. Never invent a detail the area's
  registry or board file doesn't hold.
- **`/docs/utilities/` is `skills/toil/util.md`**, rendered, with each command's flags, aliases and MCP tool from the registry; the rule that a `util` change updates it is in `docs/util.md`.
- **`/ui/` is Toil UI's showcase** (#374), in the nav and on the homepage: the real
  `ui/` app in a frame, running on its fixture `execute()` and scripted Agent, with a
  theme picker, a tour of its views, and what a theme changes about the agent (the
  prompt, the answer, the wording). Everything it says about prompts and wording is
  read from Toil UI's source at build time (`ui/scripts/showcase.ts`, which `ui/test/showcase.test.tsx` checks), never written
  out again; a source that changes shape fails the build. The app itself is static
  files at `/ui/app/`, labelled "Toil UI alpha, on sample data" on every view. `npm run
  dev` and `npm run build` build it first (`scripts/ui-preview.mjs`, into
  `ui/dist/preview/`, copied to `public/ui/app/`), so run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` at
  the repository root once (`ui/` is its workspace). `/ui-preview/`, its old address,
  forwards to `/ui/` with its query and hash, and `/ui/?theme=<name>#<route>` opens
  that theme and route in the frame (`ui/?theme=crate#/dossier/settlement`). The app's
  views are hash routes: the dossier list at `#/` and a dashboard at `#/dossier/<name>`;
  `ui/app/?theme=crate#/dossier/settlement` is the app alone, which `scripts/shoot.mjs`
  can shoot. `/docs/ui/` renders `ui/README.md`, the package's own reference.
- Internal links go through `url()` in `site/src/lib/url.ts` because the site is
  served under `/toil/`.
- **Phones get a menu.** The header's five links (Map, Connect, Toil UI, Docs,
  About) show inline from 800px, and fold into a `<details>` menu below it, which
  works without JavaScript. The footer links every page.
- Any change under `site/src/` is checked in a browser at desktop width, 375px and
  320px before the PR opens (`document.documentElement.scrollWidth` must equal the
  viewport width), with desktop and 375px screenshots in the PR. `main` clips
  horizontal overflow, so decorative art can bleed but never widen the page.
- **The dev server sometimes serves stale scoped CSS** after a component's styles
  change. If a rule you just wrote doesn't apply, check the built CSS
  (`npm --prefix site run build`, then look in `site/dist/_astro/*.css`) and restart
  the dev server before debugging specificity.

```bash
npm --prefix site ci
npm --prefix site run dev     # http://localhost:4321/toil/
npm --prefix site run build
```

### Screenshots for the PR

The browser pane's viewport emulation can paint only part of a tall page. For proof
images, run `node scripts/shoot.mjs <page>...` against the dev server (or `--base`
another): headless Chrome with a throwaway profile, full-height shots at desktop
width and 375px set through the DevTools protocol (so no iframe is needed for
Windows' minimum window width), and a sideways-scroll check at 375px and 320px that
fails the run. Host the
images on the orphan `screenshots` branch under `pr-<n>/` and link them by
`raw.githubusercontent.com` URL. That branch is never merged.
