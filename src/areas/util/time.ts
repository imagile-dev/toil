/**
 * `util time`: the date and time arithmetic that is easy to get subtly
 * wrong. Converting between zones, ISO 8601 durations, business days and
 * cron run times, all on the runtime's own Intl time zone data. Each command
 * checks its own answer a second way and says so in `data.verified`, and a
 * wall clock a zone skipped or showed twice is always a warning, never a
 * quiet choice.
 *
 * This file is only the definitions, which the registry and `--help` read at
 * startup; the work is in `./time/`, loaded when a command runs. The clock is
 * read once per call, here, and handed down, so nothing below it asks what
 * time it is. Time is, after all, a resource that requires sign-off.
