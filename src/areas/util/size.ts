 * bytes, lines and an estimated token count, plus an outline (code symbols
 * with line ranges, Markdown headings, JSON and YAML top-level keys). For a
 * folder, a `.gitignore`-aware totals tree with the largest files named.
 * Local only: it reads files and talks to nothing. The measuring module is
 * imported statically because it reads input through kit/input.ts (and so
 * zod); the outliners it calls load on first use. Measure twice, read once,
 * as the facilities department never says.
