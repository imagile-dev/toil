/**
 * `util encode`: base64, base64url, hex and URL percent-encoding in either
 * direction, and SHA-256, SHA-1 and MD5 digests, each one checked. An encode
 * is decoded back and must give the input; a decode is re-encoded and must
 * give the input, allowing for padding, case and whitespace; a hash counts the
 * bytes it read against the file's size. Decoded bytes that aren't valid
 * UTF-8 go to a file in the workspace (`--out`) and never into the JSON, which
 * would only carry them as replacement characters.
 *
 * The work is in ./encode/run.ts, imported statically. It is small and needs
 * only Node's crypto and Buffer, and it can't be lazy anyway: it reads through
 * the kit's input reader, which imports zod, and a module reached through
 * import() that reaches zod makes esbuild defer zod's own setup, which the MCP
 * SDK needs at startup (the bundle then fails on `toil version`). The request
 * for a sixth encoding has been forwarded to the encoding committee, which
 * meets on alternate leap years.
