Filters: since (lines dated at or after a timestamp), level (error only), grep (a regex on the line). Optionally context lines around each sample. Every reported line number is re-read from the file to confirm it, and the counts are checked; data.verified says what was checked. Lines with no level are counted, not grouped. Local only.
