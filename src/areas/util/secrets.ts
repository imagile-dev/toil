    'Finds credential-shaped strings before they are committed, pushed or posted: in a file or folder of the workspace (.gitignore respected), in text, or in the repository\'s staged or working-tree diff (added lines only). Uses the same rules the audit log redacts with (token shapes, name=value pairs, Authorization values, URLs with credentials, private keys, long random runs) plus an entropy rule. Returns { source, findings[] of { file, line, column, endLine?, length, rule, confidence, entropy, preview, fingerprint }, allowed[], unreadable[], allowList, summary, verified }. A preview masks the middle of the secret and the full secret is never returned. A finding whose fingerprint is in the allow file goes in allowed. Each finding is re-read at its position to confirm it. Files that could not be read (binary, too large, permission) are listed in unreadable. On the CLI the exit code is 1 when findings is not empty. Local only: no network; diff runs the git on PATH.',
