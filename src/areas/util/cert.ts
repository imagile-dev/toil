  toolDescription:
    "Decodes X.509 certificates from a PEM or DER file, or PEM text: a single certificate or a chain bundle. Never connects to a host. For each certificate returns subject, issuer, sans, serial, validity { notBefore, notAfter, daysLeft, status }, key { type, bits, curve }, signatureAlgorithm, selfSigned, basicConstraints, keyUsage, extendedKeyUsage and fingerprints { sha1, sha256 }. It checks the bundle as a chain in the order given (each certificate's issuer must be the next one's subject, and its signature must verify against the next one's key), flags expired and not-yet-valid certificates, and suggests the right order when the bundle is one chain out of order. With host, it says whether the first certificate's SANs cover that host name or IP, and why not. A block it couldn't read, or one that isn't a certificate (a private key, say), is reported by its position. data.verified lists what was checked; meta.warnings says what failed or couldn't be checked. Over MCP a DER file must be passed as file.",
