 * `util c4 render | mermaid | d2`: one view of a C4 model, as SVG laid out by
 * toil's own layered layout (./layout.ts), or as Mermaid or D2 text. Local only: no
 * connection, no host, no network. The model is JSON, read through the util
 * input reader: a file in the workspace, stdin on the CLI, or the text itself.
 * Every model is checked in full before anything is drawn, and every problem
 * is named by its path. Architecture diagrams are traditionally drawn once,
 * for the review board, and never again; these can be redrawn on every
 * commit, which the board has not yet been told.
 *
 * The work is bounded at each step: the input by the reader's cap, the model
 * by MODEL_LIMITS before the schema walks it, and render's view by
 * VIEW_LIMITS, with the layout itself in the bounded worker (kit/bounded.ts)
 * under its deadline, so a view can never hang `toil mcp`.
