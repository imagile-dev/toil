 * `util md`: one document converted between Markdown and Jira wiki markup,
 * ADF or Confluence storage format, then checked by converting it back.
 *
 *   1. The input is read into the shared tree (ast.ts), noting losses.
 *   2. The tree is written in the target format, noting losses.
 *   3. The output is read back into a tree and both trees are printed as
 *      canonical Markdown, block by block. Every block that differs is a
 *      difference; a difference with a loss reported in the same block was
 *      expected, and one without is a failed check (`MD_ROUNDTRIP_MISMATCH`).
 *   4. ADF output is validated against the ADF schema, and storage output is
 *      read back as XML, before either is returned. Neither can be returned
 *      broken.
 *
 * `lossless` is true only when nothing was lost and the round trip matched
 * block for block. The conversion is graded by the same office that issued it,
 * which is why the grading is published.
 *
 * Steps 1 to 3 run in the bounded worker (md/core.ts, kit/bounded.ts), under
 * {@link MD_LIMITS}: a document's emphasis and nesting decide what parsing
 * it costs. This module keeps the comparison and the checks.
