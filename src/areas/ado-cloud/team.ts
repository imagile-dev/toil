/**
 * What a team's board is built from: its sprints (the team's iterations, the
 * one place Azure DevOps says which sprint is current), its backlog levels and
 * their ordered items, and its boards with the columns each state sits in.
 * Every one is a read of the team's settings, under
 * `/<project>/<team>/_apis/work/…` (REST API 7.1, Work). The columns are named
 * by the team, not the process, so an item's column can't be worked out from
 * its state; the board's state mappings say which state each column holds.
 * The process defines the states, the team renames the columns, and the
 * wiki page explaining the difference was last edited by someone who has left.
