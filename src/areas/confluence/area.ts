/**
 * Confluence, both deployments in one area: Data Center (`"deployment":
 * "server"`, the default) on the Server REST API under `/rest/api`, and Cloud
 * (`"deployment": "cloud"`) on REST API v2 under `/wiki/api/v2`, with v1 under
 * `/wiki/rest/api` for what v2 doesn't cover (CQL search, adding and removing
 * labels, uploads) (#495). One command tree and one set of MCP tools serve
 * both, and each call goes to the deployment of the connection it resolves.
 * The two disagree on paths, paging and ids, so each keeps its own API code
 * under `server/` and `cloud/` and returns its own API's shape. Cloud was built
 * from Atlassian's documented API with no tested contract; the documentation
 * has signed for the delivery and nobody has opened the box.
