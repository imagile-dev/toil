/**
 * `toil projects diagram check | save | show | list | remove`: the one
 * architecture diagram a toil project keeps, in your own folder
 * (`~/.toil/diagrams/<toil-project>.json`, src/core/diagrams.ts). It is a C4
 * model (`util c4`) that says, for each thing in it, whether it was read from
 * somewhere or concluded. `check` runs every check `save` runs, so an agent
 * can fix its model before a person is asked to keep it; `save` is a local
 * write and so needs no `--allow-write`, which governs remote systems, and an
 * agent may do it over MCP; `remove` is a delete, so it stays on the CLI. A
 * diagram holds no host and no secret: a fact cites the file and line or the
 * command it came from. Every diagram is an accurate record of the system as
 * it was understood on the Thursday it was saved.
