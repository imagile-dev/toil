 * The pieces every menu screen is made of. A screen is a `View`: a title for

 * a checklist. Views are pure: they get data and return lines and actions,
 * and the loop in index.ts is the only thing that touches the terminal or
 * runs a command. Adding a module to the menu means adding a file of views
 * under views/ and one line in views/index.ts, with no form to fill in first.
