/**
 * Request paths built from ids. An id names one resource, so each value put
 * into a path goes in as exactly one segment: `apiPath` encodes every
 * interpolated value with `encodeURIComponent`, so a `/`, `?`, `#` or `%` in
 * an owner, a repo, a key or a page title is part of that name and never path
 * or query syntax. Literal text in the template is left as written.
 *
 *   apiPath`/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${number}/labels/${label}`
 *
 * A value that genuinely spans several segments (a file path in a
 * repository) goes through `segments()`, which encodes each part on its own
 * and refuses a `.` or `..` part. `rawPath()` passes text the area has
 * already encoded, for the rare value that is itself a fragment of path.
 *
 * Context inputs that land in a path also get `pathIdSchema()`, so a value
 * with path syntax in it is refused when it arrives (a flag, the dossier, an
 * env var, a git remote) rather than encoded into a name nobody has. The
 * request layer backs both up (src/core/rest.ts). One id, one segment, one
 * resource: the filing system's oldest rule, now enforced.
