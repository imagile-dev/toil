 * Areas that no longer exist under their old name, and where they went.
 * `jira-cloud` and `confluence-cloud` are `jira` and `confluence` with
 * `"deployment": "cloud"` on the connection (#495): one product, one command
 * tree, one set of MCP tools. Everything that still names the old area (a
 * config file, an env var, a dossier
 * section, `--areas`, a typed command) gets the new form from here, so no
 * place invents its own wording and none of them goes quiet.
 *
 * The old forms were retired without a deprecation period, so this table
 * is where the apology goes. Forms are filed under their new address; the
 * old address is, as ever, no longer accepting forms.
