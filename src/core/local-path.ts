/**
 * Paths a call hands toil name a file on this machine. On Windows a path that
 * starts with two slashes (`\\host\share\x`, `//host/share/x`) names a file on
 * another machine, and simply asking whether it exists makes Windows open a
 * connection to that host. A device path
 * (`\\?\C:\x`, `\\.\pipe\x`, `\??\x`) skips the normal path rules altogether.
 * So both are refused by looking at the text alone, before any `node:fs` call
 * sees them, and the realpath-based bounds (docs/bounds.md) run only on what's
 * left.
 *
 * The one place a network path is fine is inside a workspace that is itself
 * on a share: the user chose that folder, so a file in it is as local as the
 * workspace is. A device path is never fine.
 *
 * The check reads both slash kinds on every platform, so the same input is
 * refused the same way on Windows, macOS and Linux (principle 8). A file on a
 * share is, for filing purposes, held at another branch office.
