/**
 * What a pasted secret looks like when it arrives, checked before it goes to
 * the OS credential store (#358). One function, `checkSecret()`, decides every
 * case, and every way of entering a secret uses it: the CLI's terminal
 * prompter (through `askCheckedSecret()`), a host's `person` through the API,
 * and Toil UI's password fields, which run it in the page. So a terminal and
 * a form say the same thing in the same words, and can't drift apart.
 *
 * Nothing here shows any part of the value: not a prefix, not a suffix, not a
 * hash. What it reports is the length, the whitespace it took off the ends,
 * and the wrapper it found ("Bearer ", "token ", quotes), which is boilerplate
 * and never the secret. A paste is checked for the usual accidents, the way a
 * form is checked for a missing signature, except that this one tells you which box.
