/**
 * The text a person's own AI agent is given to sharpen a scheme from the
 * corrections people made (#566, Step 4). It holds the scheme as it is, a few
 * lines of the ledger's statistics, and the corrections that were not held
 * back, and it asks for a revised scheme and for each change tied to the
 * corrections it answers. Titles and reasons are other people's words, so they
 * sit in the same kind of fence the classify prompt uses and are called data.
 * The last paragraph tells the agent that it may propose and a person applies;
 * the policy is repeated here because the audit committee reads prompts and
 * agents, on the whole, do not read policies.
