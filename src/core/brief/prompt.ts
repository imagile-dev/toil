 * The Analyze prompt (#494): the standard method for briefing a dossier, as
 * the dossier tunes it, in one order every host sends it. Toil UI sends it
 * with its own rules (its cache tools, citations as `[[id]]`, proposals) in
 * front; `toil dossiers analyze prompt` and the MCP prompt `analyze` send it
 * to any agent with toil's tools. The method and the answer's shape are
 * toil's; a dossier changes the lenses, their order and thresholds, the
 * reader, and its focus, and the focus is told the rules win over it. The
 * focus is labelled with where it came from, so a dossier checked into
 * someone else's repository can't pass its words off as the reader's own,
 * and anything it left out is listed (the maintainer's decision on #494).
 * Briefing notes for the briefing, approved at the briefing about briefings.
