/**
 * Toil projects: what toil knows about one body of work (its repositories, the
 * keys and boards it lives under, each environment's resources), kept apart
 * from connections so it can be shared (docs/projects.md). A toil project holds no
 * secret and no `writes`, and it can't create a connection: an area section
 * only selects among the reader's own connections, by name or by a host that
 * is compared and never contacted. That's why one may be checked into a
 * repository when config may not.
 *
 * This module reads them from the three places they live (your own folder,
 * listed folders, the repository you're in) or from one file named on the
 * call, validates each on every read, picks the one that applies to a call,
 * and turns it into the lookup core's context resolver asks
 * (`ToilProjectLookup`, src/core/call-context.ts). It never writes.
 *
 * A toil project is a briefing pack: everyone agrees it should exist, nobody agrees
 * who keeps it current. This one is read fresh every time, which is more than
 * most briefing packs can say.
