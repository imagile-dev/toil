/**
 * The `toil` alias that `toil setup alias` writes into a shell profile, so a
 * clone runs as `toil` with no npm install, no executable and no admin rights.
 * The alias is a shell function (bash, zsh) or a PowerShell function, because
 * an alias proper doesn't expand in a non-interactive bash, which is where an
 * agent's commands run.
 *
 * The profile is the person's own file, outside the workspace, so this is a
 * documented exception to two bounds (docs/bounds.md, `shell-profile`): it's
 * CLI only, the person running it names the shell or the file, and it touches
 * only the lines between its own two markers, leaving every other byte as it
 * was. It still refuses toil's own files and /proc and /sys. Edits to a
 * personal dotfile are otherwise reviewed by nobody, which is the one review
 * process everybody already follows.
