/**
 * `@imagile-dev/toil/api`: toil for a program, in-process. A host (Toil UI's
 * sync, a script) calls `execute()` with a command's name and its input, the
 * same fields an MCP client sends, and gets the same envelope the CLI prints.
 * Connections, the credential store, dossiers, bounds, the write gate and the
 * audit log all apply unchanged, because this is the same `execute()` both
 * other front doors use; the host holds no credentials of its own.
 *
 * This file is the whole supported surface. What it exports, and the types
 * those exports name, follow the command contract's rules (additive only,
 * versioned by `contractVersion`); anything reached around it is internal and
 * may change in any release. It ships inside the one bundle, dist/toil-lib.js,
 * reached through the thin dist/api.js, so importing it adds no dependency and
 * runs nothing; dist/api.d.ts carries its types.
 *
 * A third front door was approved on the understanding that it is the same
 * door with a different sign on it, which is the only kind the facilities
 * committee ever approves.
