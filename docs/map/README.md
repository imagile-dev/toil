# Map of toil

A map of this repository, kept so a question about its structure reads the map instead
of the code. It was made by the workflow page `skills/toil/workflows/map-codebase.md`,
which is also how it is refreshed.

- **Commit mapped:** `333cf9ca77a624b21b1604f44946327318ba660d`
- **toil version used:** `0.1.0-beta.3`
- **Files:** [`map.json`](map.json) (modules, edges, hubs, decisions, what is not mapped)
  and [`model.json`](model.json) (the C4 model, input to `toil util c4`)
- **Diagrams (SVG):** [context](context.svg), [containers](containers.svg),
  [components](components.svg) (the components of `core`)

Everything is **observed** (read from source or a command, cited in its description) or
**inferred** (its description starts with `(inferred)` and says why). The map has 15
observed and 2 inferred modules and 19 observed and 6 inferred edges; the model has 25
observed and 3 inferred elements and 24 observed and 8 inferred relationships.
The hubs are `core` (10 modules have an edge into it) and `registry` (3).

**Not mapped:** `dist/` (generated bundle), the insides of `src/areas/*` beyond each
index file's imports, tests, `ui/` and `site/` beyond folder sizes, schema JSON, and the
services toil would read at runtime (no connection). `map.json` lists each.
