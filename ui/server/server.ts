/**
 * The local server (#206, Local first): Node's own `node:http`, no framework,
 * so the package's only runtime dependency stays toil. It serves the built
 * SPA and a small JSON API under the base path, on loopback, behind a lock:
 *
 * - **Loopback only.** The server binds `127.0.0.1` or `::1` (settings.ts
 *   refuses any other address) and refuses a request whose peer isn't loopback.
 * - **A cookie, and no step for the person** (#561, the maintainer's call).
 *   There is no launch token, session id, CSRF header or browser storage.
 *   Toil UI keeps a machine secret in its data folder (machine-secret.ts); when
 *   a browser navigates to the app page itself (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: document`,
 *   `Sec-Fetch-Site` none or same-origin) the server sets a cookie signed with
 *   it: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, 30 days, no data in it. It is not
 *   `Secure`, because a browser won't keep that over plain http. Every API call
 *   needs a valid cookie, compared in constant time. A cross-site page's request
 *   doesn't carry a SameSite=Strict cookie, and the checks below refuse it anyway.
 * - **The Host header.** Only `127.0.0.1:<port>`, `localhost:<port>` and
 *   `[::1]:<port>` are answered, so a page using DNS rebinding to reach the
 *   port under its own name is refused before anything else is read.
 * - **Origin and Fetch Metadata.** An API call whose `Origin` is present and
 *   isn't the origin the request was addressed to, or whose `Sec-Fetch-Site` is
 *   present and isn't `same-origin`, is refused. A POST must be
 *   `application/json`, which a plain cross-site form can't send. These, with
 *   SameSite=Strict, are why no CSRF header is needed.
 * - **No CORS.** No `Access-Control-*` header is ever sent, and `OPTIONS` is
 *   refused, so no other page can read an answer or pass a preflight.
 *
 *   What this does not do: any program running on this machine as the same
 *   user can read the machine secret, or fetch the page the way a browser does
 *   and get a cookie. Cookies are not scoped to a port, so another local web
 *   server on 127.0.0.1 is sent this one too. The static files hold no data.
 *
 * Every request becomes a `RequestContext` with its viewer before a Store or
 * Agent sees it. Reads are only the commands the views make (`READ_COMMANDS`),
 * always read-only. A config change (#253) is only a command on the server's
 * config allowlist (ui/server/config.ts): toil's own commands for its
 * connections and toil projects, with the person's answers to their questions. The
 * Feedback (#265) is `toil feedback` alone, on `feedback`: read-only for the
 * dialog's preview, and sent only with the person's `consent`, which answers
 * the command's own consent question. The
 * agent (#251) answers on `agent/ask`, streamed as NDJSON when asked, and its
 * settings are `agent/settings`, the person's instructions and custom voice
 * among them (#283), and `agent/prompt` shows the system prompt a question
 * would get in the page's theme. `agent/mcp` is the one route with a
 * credential of its own: it serves one question's read tools to the Codex CLI, by that
 * question's bearer token, and refuses anything carrying a page's `Origin`.
 * The worklog (#308) is `worklog/month`, `worklog/day` and `worklog/standup` (#345) to read, and
 * `worklog/rebuild`, `worklog/note` and `worklog/export`, each an explicit
 * press on the page: a note goes into the cache, and an export is a file
 * toil's file service writes in the folder the person named.
 * The history of analyses (#395) is `analyses` and `analyses/one`, read
 * only: the server keeps each Analyze itself as its answer ends whole, and
 * says which on the answer's last line, so nothing the page sends writes one.
 * The building has one door, a doorman who reads the visitor's address, and a
 * guest book, and the guest book is toil's audit log. The key was retired.
