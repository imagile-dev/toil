/**
 * What the agent is told (#251): the system prompt every adapter sends, and

 * enforced, on the server, whatever the model does: it has only read tools,
 * and answer.ts flags any id its tools never returned. Belt, braces, and a
 * second belt.
 *
 * The prompt is composed in one order (#283): the rules, unchanged in every
 * theme; then "Style:", the theme's voice (or the person's custom voice) when
 * "Themed agent voice" is on and the theme has one; then the person's own
 * instructions. Each later part says the rules win over it, so a voice
 * changes phrasing and nothing else. Pure, so the page can show the same
 * prompt the server sends.
