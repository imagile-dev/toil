/**
 * The agent the server runs (#251): one `Agent` that answers through the
 * adapter chosen in Settings (Claude, Copilot or Codex), or through the
 * fallback (`noAgent`, which names the three) when none is chosen. It also
 * reports which SDKs and CLIs are on this machine for the Settings page, and
 * saves the choice to `~/.toil-ui/agent.json`.
 *
 * Every question runs with the toil project's read-only tools and a fresh ledger,
 * streams its text, and ends with answer.ts's checks: citations held to the
 * tool results, writes turned into proposals the pane shows and nobody here
 * runs. Each question is recorded as an agent run (#308) as it starts and
 * again as it ends, finished, failed or stopped, with its answer and
 * proposals, for the worklog. A switchboard with three lines and no outgoing
 * calls.
 *
 * Usage (#295): every adapter hands what its SDK reports to a sink here,
 * which stamps each report with the chat, turn, toil project and time, prices
 * Codex's from the person's rates. Whatever the outcome, the run's records go
 * to the ledger before the answer or the error does, and the answer carries them.
