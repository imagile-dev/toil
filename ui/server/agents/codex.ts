/**
 * The Codex adapter (#251): the Codex SDK (`@openai/codex-sdk`, an optional
 * peer dependency) running the `codex` CLI already on this machine
 * (`codexPathOverride`), so the copy the SDK's own dependency brings is never
 * started. It signs in the way the CLI does (a ChatGPT plan or the CLI's own
 * API key setup); Toil UI passes no key.
 *
 * Codex takes tools only from MCP servers, so Toil UI serves the dossier's
 * read tools for the length of one run on its own loopback server
 * (`api/agent/mcp`, server.ts), behind a bearer token made for the run. The
 * token reaches Codex in its environment (`bearer_token_env_var`), never on
 * its command line, where any process could read it.
 *
 * Codex runs in a Codex home of Toil UI's own (#300), `<data folder>/cache/codex`,
 * never the user's. Codex merges a `--config` table into the config in its
 * home rather than replacing it, so with the user's home every MCP server,
 * profile, plugin, hook, skill and AGENTS.md of theirs came along (#287).
 * Toil UI's home holds a `config.toml` it rewrites before every run and one
 * other file: `auth.json`, a hard link to the one in the user's own Codex home
 * (`$CODEX_HOME`, else `~/.codex`). A hard link is the same file under a
 * second name, not a copy, so there is still one sign-in: a token Codex
 * refreshes in either home is the token in both, and signing out of Codex
 * (which deletes the user's file) is noticed on the next question, which
 * removes the link. Without the file, an API key in `CODEX_API_KEY` still
 * signs in. The home sits under the
 * cache, so `toil-ui wipe` takes Codex's record of Toil UI's questions with it;
 * deleting a hard link leaves the user's file where it was.
 *
 * The shell, apps, plugins, sub-agents, browser and web search are switched
 * off, and the sandbox is read-only with approvals never asked.
 * Options checked against the SDK's index.d.ts at 0.160.0; the feature names
 * against `codex features list` from codex-cli 0.156.0. A spare key to the
 * same office, cut so nobody has to queue for the original.
