/**
 * From a model's text to an `Answer` (#251), and the server-side checks on it:
 *
 * - **Citations.** The model cites items as `[[<owi id>]]`. Every id an answer
 *   names (cited, written bare as `<connection>:<key>`, or a tracker key such
 *   as PAY-101) must be one its tool calls returned, by the ledger
 *   (tools.ts). Anything else is listed in `unverified` and the pane flags it,
 *   because an id the tools never returned is one the model made up or
 *   remembered. An answer that read items and cites none gets a warning too.
 * - **Writes as proposals.** A change the model wants is a fenced
 *   ```` ```proposal ```` block of JSON. It becomes a `Proposal` the pane shows
 *   as a card, its command line rendered by the one safe renderer
 *   (src/proposal.ts). The command must be one toil's registry has and marks
 *   as a write; otherwise the card says toil has no such command. Nothing here
 *   or anywhere in the agent runs it: the agent's tools are reads only.
 *
 * The shape the model is asked to write is in prompts.ts. An editor with a
 * red pen and no publishing rights.
