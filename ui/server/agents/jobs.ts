/**
 * The question a workflow job asks the agent (#532, part of #526). A job is a
 * page of the toil skill (src/model/jobs.ts): its steps are toil commands, its
 * writes are named in its frontmatter. Toil UI's agent already reads through
 * toil's read tools and turns every write into a proposal a person presses, so
 * running a job is asking that agent to follow the page, told plainly what is
 * different here: no shell, no working tree, no write tool. The page's own
 * words are sent as they are, so the page and the run can't drift. A loop's
 * rounds are counted from the runs the worklog holds, and the one after its
 * limit is refused, with `needs-human` named, instead of quietly run. Minutes
 * of a meeting held one agenda item at a time, with a hard stop.
