/**
 * The Classify view's server (#566): every step of sorting work into
 * categories that needs a file or an AI agent, run through toil's own commands
 * and nothing else. The page names a toil project and sends items or ids;
 * never a command, a file or a path, as an assignment's Apply names a docket
 * number and never the parcel. What it does:
 *
 * - **Reads** (`classify stats --standing`, `classify scheme show`): the
 *   ledger's figures and each item's last say, run read-only.
 * - **Ask your AI agent**: toil's own `classify prompt` is what the agent is
 *   given, on the adapter the person chose, with no tool at all. Its answer is
 *   checked by `readVerdicts` (every id one of the items, every category one
 *   of the scheme's, or unsure) exactly as `classify run --verdicts` would,
 *   and comes back as answers for a person to accept. The agent never applies
 *   anything: it has no tool to, and this file calls no `categorize` for it.
 * - **Plan and Apply**: `classify run` (with `recheck`, so a person's say
 *   outranks a label already on the item, over the decided items only) makes
 *   the plan; Apply writes it to a file in Toil UI's own workspace folder
 *   through toil's file service (`--summary-file`), then runs the tracker's
 *   own `categorize` on it with `allowWrite`, behind the connection's `writes`.
 *   Then `classify run --record`, with the same input and flags, tells the
 *   ledger what the verdicts are. Running it twice changes nothing.
 * - **Tune**: `classify tune`, the agent, `readScheme`, the revised scheme and
 *   the held-back answers staged as files, `classify stats --backtest`. Its
 *   Apply is `classify scheme set` as a person's command, which an agent can
 *   never run and this server runs only on a press.
 *
 * Every file goes in `<data folder>/classify/`, written by `util encode --out`
 * (toil's file service: new files only, never toil's own folder). The ledger
 * is read and written only by toil. Filed in duplicate, under a name that
 * cannot repeat.
