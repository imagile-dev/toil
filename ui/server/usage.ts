/**
 * The model usage ledger and its settings, server side (#295). The ledger is
 * where the agent's usage records go: the cache's `usage` table for a real
 * Toil UI (server/cache.ts), kept apart from what a sync writes, or one in
 * memory for the tests. The settings are the caps and the Codex rates, in
 * Toil UI's own data folder (`~/.toil-ui/usage.json`) beside agent.json,
 * never toil's config and never the cache, so a wipe deletes the figures but
 * not the limits. A file that doesn't parse names the setting at fault, and
 * every question is refused until it's fixed: a cap is never read as off
 * because its file was broken. The adding-up is src/model-usage.ts's alone.
 * A ledger, kept in pencil, audited in pen.
