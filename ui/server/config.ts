/**
 * The server's side of the settings pages (#253, item 4). `/api/config` runs
 * only `CONFIG_COMMANDS` (src/config.ts): toil's own commands for its
 * connections and dossiers, through the Store's `execute()`, with the
 * `toil-ui` caller label like every other call. The reads among them run
 * read-only; the changes run with readOnly off and each command's own write
 * gate unchanged.
 *
 * A change's questions (a connection's settings and secrets, "Save it?", the
 * typed name that turns writes on) come with the request, as the person typed
 * them on the page. `personFrom()` makes toil's `person` from them: it answers
 * each question by its id, and a hidden question only from `secrets`, so a
 * secret is never the answer to a visible question. Nothing here logs,
 * stores or returns any of it. Answers in, envelope out, nothing kept.
