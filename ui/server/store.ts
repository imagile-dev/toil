/**
 * The Store: where the server gets what a view shows (#206, Hosting-ready by
 * design). The SPA reads through one seam, toil's own `execute()` signature
 * (src/toil.ts), so a Store answers toil calls. Three ship beside each other
 * and one is chosen at startup:
 *
 * - `sqliteStore`: the SQLite cache (#250), answering the views' calls from
 *   what a sync stored (server/sync.ts). `toil-ui` picks it.
 * - `toilStore`: toil itself, in-process through `@imagile-dev/toil/api`, with
 *   the user's own connections and dossiers, every call live. Every call is
 *   `caller: 'toil-ui'` in the audit log.
 * - `fixtureStore`: the preview's fixture `execute()` and its sample data, for
 *   `toil-ui --sample`, the site preview and the tests.
 *
 * The server, not the Store, decides what a call may do: a read
 * from `READ_COMMANDS` always goes `readOnly`, a config change only for a
 * command in the server's config allowlist (#253), and anything else is
 * refused before a Store sees it. Two locks on one door, and both keys stay
 * with the tenant.
