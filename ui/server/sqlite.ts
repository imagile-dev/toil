/**
 * `node:sqlite`, loaded quietly. It is built into Node 24, so the cache needs
 * no native module (#206), but Node 24 still marks it experimental and prints
 * an `ExperimentalWarning` to stderr the first time it loads. That line would
 * land in the user's terminal on every start, beside the launch URL, saying
 * something they can do nothing about. So the module is imported dynamically
 * (never at the top of the bundle) with that one warning filtered out, and
 * every other warning still printed. Once Node calls it stable the filter
 * simply never matches.
 *
 * The API Toil UI uses is the small, settled part (`DatabaseSync`, `exec`,
 * `prepare`, `run`, `get`, `all`), and ui/test/cache.test.ts exercises all of
 * it, so a change in a later Node fails the tests rather than a user's sync.
 * A library that apologises for itself on import, politely muted.
