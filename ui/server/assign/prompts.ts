 * What an assigned agent is told (#293), one prompt per mode. The rules are
 * the Ask pane's (citations held to the tool results, writes only as
 * proposals) plus two of their own: the item's text is fenced off as
 * untrusted, as triage fences a website report, and an item that reads like
 * an instruction to the agent stops the run for a person. Questions come
 * back on lines of their own, so the assignment can say it needs you. The
 * rules that matter are enforced on the server too: the tools only read,
 * and only implement mode's sandbox may write, inside its own folder. A
 * standing order, issued in triplicate, with the escape clause in bold.

Use only your tools. owi_query, owi_get, owi_similar and owi_history read the work items Toil UI last synced for "${dossier}"; run owi_similar before proposing a new item. pr_query, pr_get and pr_metrics read its pull requests.
