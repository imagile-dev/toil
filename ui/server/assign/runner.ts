/**
 * The runner behind Toil UI's assignments (#293): one agent run per
 * assignment, through the AgentHost's `task()`, so every run goes through
 * the same SDK loading, environment allowlist, usage ledger and caps as a
 * question in the Ask pane (#295). Per mode:
 *
 * - **refine** and **investigate** get the dossier's read-only tools (the
 *   cache's owi_* and pr_* tools, toil's live reads, proposal_fields) and no
 *   shell, no file writes. The finished text goes through answer.ts's
 *   checks: every id held to the tools' results, every proposal to toil's
 *   registry. Investigate's report becomes a "post as a comment" proposal.
 * - **implement** runs on Codex alone, the one adapter whose own sandbox
 *   holds commands and writes to one folder with no network on every OS
 *   Toil UI supports. The folder is under the cache. Toil UI copies the
 *   dossier repository's git directory into its `repo` (`prepareClone`), and
 *   the agent fills the working tree from the last commit, branches,
 *   changes and stages. Then, before any git runs outside the sandbox,
 *   Toil UI takes the clone's git directory back (`reclaimGitDir`: its own
 *   config, no hooks), reads the branch from `.git/HEAD` and the staged diff
 *   through toil's own read-only `git status` and `git diff`, and proposes
 *   the commit and push as git lines for a person to run, since toil has no
 *   command that pushes.
 *
 * Every tool call is in the transcript, and every call toil makes for the
 * run is in toil's audit log as `caller: "toil-ui"` with the assignment as
 * its `actor`. A runner's brief, stamped, with the carbon copy filed first.
