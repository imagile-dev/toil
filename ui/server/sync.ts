/**
 * The sync job (#250, #206 point 2: sync through toil, not around it). It
 * calls toil's own commands in-process through `@imagile-dev/toil/api`'s
 * `execute()`, read-only and named `toil-ui` in the audit log, so
 * connections, the credential store, dossiers, bounds and the audit log all
 * apply unchanged and Toil UI holds no credential of its own.
 *
 * **What it asks for is what the dashboards ask for.** Each dossier is loaded
 * with the views' own loader (src/load.ts), driven by `dossiers show`, through
 * an `execute()` that goes to toil, so the cache holds exactly the calls the
 * views will make and they render from it unchanged. On the way, that
 * `execute()` makes the sync incremental:
 *
 * - **Searches** (`jira issue search`, `ado work-item search`, `github
 *   list-issues`) ask only for what changed since the source's watermark, with
 *   `updatedSince`, and merge the answer into the last copy by key.
 * - **The GitHub board** (`github project items`) is read whole, and an
 *   item counts as changed when its issue's `updatedAt` moved.
 * - **Batches** (`ado work-item get-many`, `github issue get`) fetch only the
 *   changed and new items, merged into the last copy.
 * - **Histories** (`jira issue history`, `ado work-item history`, `github
 *   issue-events`) are fetched only for changed and new items; the rest are
 *   the last copy.
 * - **Azure DevOps' revision feed** (`ado work-item revisions`) is read from
 *   the start of the window the first time and from the watermark after that,
 *   and the new revisions are laid over the last copy by item and revision
 *   number, so a changed item's history grows by what it did instead of being
 *   read again whole. Only an item whose revisions run from 1 to its own `rev`
 *   is mapped from the feed (src/ado-revisions.ts); the rest are read with
 *   `ado work-item history`, through the histories rule above.
 * - **Pull request lists** (every host's `pr list`) ask only for what changed
 *   since the watermark too, with `updatedSince`, merged into the last copy
 *   by id; and a **pull request's get** is read again only when it changed
 *   or is still open, since a check finishing doesn't count as an update on
 *   every host. A closed one that didn't change is the last copy.
 * - **Everything else** (builds, deployments, iterations) has no "changed
 *   since" in toil, so it is read again, bounded as the loader already bounds
 *   it.
 * - **Deleted and moved items** never show up in a search "since" a
 *   watermark, so once a day (`RECONCILE_MS`) a source's search is also sent
 *   whole, asking for ids only where the command can (Jira's `--fields key`;
 *   a WIQL answer is ids already), and a cached item it no longer lists is
 *   dropped. Between those, the merge by id goes on as before. GitHub's
 *   issue list has no window, so it is left out. A whole listing that fails
 *   keeps the merged delta, says so in the job's messages and is tried again
 *   by the next sync.
 * - **The window.** The loader asks Jira and Azure DevOps for open items and
 *   what changed within the read window (the retention period, at least six
 *   weeks), not the whole project. Its per-item calls run through the pool in
 *   `src/load.ts`.
 *
 * Every call follows `meta.page.nextCursor` to the end, up to `MAX_PAGES`,
 * and says so when it stops there (Bounds). Work items go through `mapOwi`.
 *
 * **A failing source never blanks the others.** Each area a dossier reads is
 * a source with its own state. When a call fails, the loader is handed that
 * call's last good copy, so the dashboard keeps it; the source is marked
 * failed with toil's message and fix, its watermark stays where it was so the
 * next sync asks again, and the views show its data as stale. A dossier
 * whose `dossiers show` fails keeps everything it had.
 *
 * Progress comes from `execute()`'s own events (requests, pages, retries) and
 * is polled by the page (GET api/sync). One job runs at a time. A relay race
 * where every runner checks the baton has the right serial number.
