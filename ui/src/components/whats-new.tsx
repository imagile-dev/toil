/**
 * What's new (#417): after an upgrade, a dot on the header's Help, and
 * Help's "What's new" opens what changed in toil and Toil UI since this
 * browser last saw them, a few lines a version, with a link to each full
 * changelog. The versions this browser last saw are kept here only; a first
 * visit records them and shows no dot, since nothing was upgraded. Opening
 * the list counts as seeing it. Nothing pops up over the page, and nothing is
 * fetched: the lines were built into the bundle (src/whats-new.ts).
 * The memo nobody reads, now three lines long and with a dot on it.
