/**
 * The sample history of analyses (#395), for the site preview and `toil-ui
 * --sample`: card-payments has two earlier Analyze answers from the scripted
 * agent, so the Analyses tab, its what-changed view and the Overview's
 * recommendation have something to show, while settlement and checkout-web
 * have none, so the code's own recommendation shows there. The latest is
 * today's scripted answer on the sample as it is; the one before it is
 * scripted too, on a snapshot made a few days earlier by hand: PAY-103 not
 * yet blocked, PAY-104 then waiting on PAY-105, PAY-102 estimated at two
 * points fewer, and three fewer points done. Every record says it was the
 * scripted preview, not a model. The latest is from the sample's own
 * morning, so the Overview leads with it. Analyze pressed in the preview is kept
 * beside them, in memory, until the page reloads. Two meetings, minuted
 * before anyone arrived.
