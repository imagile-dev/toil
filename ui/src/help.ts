/**
 * The help topics (#346): every (i) in Toil UI and every Read more link it
 * opens, defined once. A topic is one or two sentences and the exact docs
 * section that says the rest, on the site: `/docs/` for toil's own concepts
 * (connections, toil projects, writes, the audit log) and `/docs/ui/` and
 * `/docs/themes/` for the app. `ui/test/help.test.tsx`
 * resolves every link against the docs' own headings, and the site build
 * checks each one again against the pages it built
 * (`site/scripts/check-help-links.mjs`), so a renamed heading fails a build
 * rather than a reader. Plain data with no imports, so the site's build
 * script can read it as it is.
 * Every form now comes with its own guidance notes, filed separately, as is customary.
 *
 * Some topics also carry `glossary` entries (#418): an AI term the topic's
 * screen uses, its first sentence, and a Read more link to its page in
 * Context Overflow's glossary. Linking to that site is the maintainer's
 * decision of 2026-10-22, recorded on #418 and in principle 6 as its one
 * exception to the rule that the docs and code name no other project. The sentences are Context Overflow's
 * own, copied into this file by hand from its glossary's term files (the first
 * sentence of each `description:`) and attributed to it here; nothing is
 * fetched while the app runs. `ui/test/help.test.tsx` holds every slug to a
 * pinned copy of the glossary's term list. "Links to learning content" under
 * Settings, General turns all of it off (src/learning.ts).
