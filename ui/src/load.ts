/**
 * How a dashboard fills itself: `projects show` first, then, for each area the
 * toil project covers, the toil commands that read its work items, pull requests,
 * builds and deployments, every one read-only and named `toil-ui` in the audit
 * log. What the toil project holds decides what is asked: its Jira project, its
 * Azure DevOps pipelines, its GitHub project board (or, with none named, the
 * repository's issues), the namespace of each environment. Every call is kept
 * with the panel it fed, so the panel can say so, and a call that fails is
 * shown on its panel with toil's own message and fix (principle 4), never
 * dropped.
 *
 * Jira and Azure DevOps are asked for open items and what changed within a
 * window of days (windowFor), not the whole project, and the per-item calls
 * (histories, pull request gets) run through one pool of PER_ITEM_CONCURRENCY
 * across the toil project.
 *
 * Work items and pull requests go through `mapOwi` (src/owi.ts), pull
 * requests as OWI 0.2 changes: each code host's `pr list`, then `pr get
 * --include reviews,checks,commits,files` for every open one and the newest
 * closed ones. Builds and deployments go through src/model/delivery.ts. One
 * loader, one toil project, no spreadsheet.
