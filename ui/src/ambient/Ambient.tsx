/**
 * The layer behind every view where a game theme keeps its particles (#271),
 * on one canvas. Plain gets nothing at all. It is decoration, hidden from
 * screen readers and from the pointer, painted behind the page so no
 * particle ever crosses a panel. With motion unwelcome, by the OS or by
 * Settings, the canvas is never started.
 *
 * The particles are whatever preset the theme's theme.json names (#348), and
 * a theme's own "Particles and ambient effects" switch removes them outright:
 * no canvas, no frame and no layer. A theme's still backdrop (Crate's grid
 * and glow, Starship's starfield) is its own stylesheet's, on the body, so it
 * stays when the particles go (#397). The particles' colours follow the scheme
 * showing, and the engine restarts when it changes (#507). Crate's pallets were
 * moved off this layer in #397, and the forklift certification lapsed with them.
