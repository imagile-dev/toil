/**
 * Which theme and colour scheme are showing, and how deep the theme goes
 * (#283): "Themed wording" (the theme's lexicon) and "Themed agent voice" (its
 * voice in the agent's prompt), both on unless switched off. A `?theme=`,
 * `?scheme=`, `?wording=off` or `?voice=off` in the address wins (it makes a
 * view linkable as it looked), then what this browser picked last, then
 * Crate, the default (#277), with both on. The choice is a convenience, so
 * storage that refuses (a private window, blocked site data) just means it
 * isn't remembered. Preferences are honoured without a request form.
 *
 * The theme is also toil's own setting (#427): `"theme"` in the person's
 * config, which the welcome menu follows too. Once `toil theme list` answers,
 * its theme shows, unless the address names one, or this browser saved a theme
 * before the setting existed and no one has picked since (that browser keeps
 * its theme until the first pick). TOIL_THEME, the env over the file, wins over
 * a saved theme as well. A pick writes the setting with `toil theme set`, and
 * says so on the page if toil refuses. The preview, which changes nothing,
 * reads and writes neither.
