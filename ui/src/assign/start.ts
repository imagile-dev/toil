/**
 * The Command Center's "start every ready item" (#307), on the assignment
 * queue (#293). A ready item is one an agent can pick up, so each one in the
 * plan is assigned in implement mode, in the order it was slated, on the
 * adapter chosen in Settings when it can implement, else on the first one
 * that can, in the dossier's one repository with a local path. The queue
 * runs them as its limits allow; an item that already has an implement
 * assignment queued or working is left alone, and an item that can't be
 * queued is named beside the ones that were. Anything that stops the plan
 * before it starts (no adapter that can implement, no repository, or two to
 * choose between) is an error that says so, and nothing is queued. One
 * stamp, many forms, all in triplicate.
