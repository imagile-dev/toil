/**
 * Assigning a work item to an agent (#293): the shapes the server, the page
 * and the preview share, and the pure rules they all apply. A person picks
 * an item, an adapter (Claude, Copilot or Codex) and one mode:
 *
 * - **refine** drafts acceptance criteria, an estimate, a split into
 *   children and open questions, all as write proposals;
 * - **investigate** researches the item across the dossier's sources and
 *   writes a report that cites them, saved with the assignment; posting it
 *   as a comment is a proposal;
 * - **implement** works the item in a clone of the dossier's repository, on
 *   a new local branch `agent/<key>`; pushing it and opening a pull request
 *   are proposals.
 *
 * Nothing an agent does leaves the machine until a person applies a
 * proposal, which runs toil's write command through its own gate. The
 * states (`queued`, `working`, `needs-you`, `done`, `failed`), the events and
 * the record of what each run started on are what later work hooks into:
 * notifications (#306), stale sessions (#305) and matching the work to a
 * ticket (#304). A delegation form with a counter-signature box, and the box
 * is load-bearing.
