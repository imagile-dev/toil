/**
 * Azure DevOps has two ways to say how a work item changed. `ado work-item
 * history <id>` lists one item's revisions, and `ado work-item revisions` is
 * the project's reporting feed, every revision of every item from a date on
 * (#493). `mapOwi` reads the first; a sync that asked for each of 3000 items
 * would rather read the second. This is the adapter between them, and its one
 * rule is that nothing partial is ever mapped as if whole.
 *
 * **When the feed's revisions of an item are that item's history.** A feed that
 * starts at a date holds only the later revisions of an item created before it,
 * and an open item nobody has touched since holds none. So an item's revisions
 * are taken from the feed only when they are exactly 1 to the item's own `rev`
 * (as `get-many` read it): no gap, nothing past it, nothing missing at the
 * start. `rev` counts an item's saves, so a run from 1 to `rev` is every
 * revision there is, whatever the item's created date or the feed's start. Any
 * other item is named in `incomplete`, and the loader reads it with `work-item
 * history`, which reads the whole of it.
 *
 * **What else has to look the same.** `mapOwi` reads a revision's `rev`,
 * `System.ChangedDate`, `System.ChangedBy`, `System.State` and the iteration
 * path (`System.IterationPath`, or the dossier's own field). The feed sends
 * people as `Name <email>` text where `work-item history` sends an identity
 * object, and `mapOwi` reads both to the same person. An item is left to
 * `work-item history` too when the dossier points `mapOwi` at a field of its
 * own for the iteration (the feed sends reportable fields only, and nothing
 * here can tell an empty one from a missing one), when a revision has no
 * `System.ChangedDate`, or when `System.ChangedBy` is text that is not `Name
 * <email>`. Those are the doubts this file can see; the rest are in
 * docs/decisions/493-ado-revisions.md.
 *
 * Two lists of one history have been known to need a steering committee. This is a function.
