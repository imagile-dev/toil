/**
 * The "thinking" indicator's words (#561): while an AI helper answers, the Ask
 * bar shows a small moving icon and a phrase in the theme's voice that changes
 * every few seconds. The phrases are flavour. What is true (how long it has
 * been, which tool the agent is reading) is always said plainly beside them,
 * and the phrase gives way entirely once the agent names a tool or starts
 * writing (`statusLine` in components/ask.tsx), because from then on we know
 * what it is doing and a joke about turnips would be a claim of its own
 * (principle 4).
 *
 * Every function here is pure and takes the elapsed time as an argument, so
 * the rotation is the same on every run and testable without a clock. There is
 * no randomness: a phrase is chosen by how many whole intervals have passed.
 * Rotating the phrases is the only form of progress reporting permitted
 * without a progress bar, a sponsor or a steering committee.
