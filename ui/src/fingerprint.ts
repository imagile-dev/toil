/**
 * Stale sessions (#305): what an agent session started on, and whether the
 * ground has moved under it since. A chat or an assignment records an
 * install fingerprint when it starts; every check works out the current one
 * and compares. Pure, so the server, the page and the preview all say the
 * same thing in the same words.
 *
 * - **toil** and **Toil UI**: each one's version and the commit it was built
 *   from. A session records what the server runs; the current one is what is
 *   on disk, so an upgrade marks the sessions stale before anyone restarts.
 * - **skills**: one SHA-256 per toil area of the tools the agent was handed
 *   (each tool's name, description and input). Toil UI loads no skill page:
 *   those tools are the toil instructions its agents read.
 * - **dossier**: SHA-256 of the dossier as `toil dossiers show` reads it.
 * - **prompts**: SHA-256 of the system prompt and the starter or task
 *   prompts, with the person's own instructions and voice.
 *
 * A session Toil UI didn't start (or one recorded before fingerprints were)
 * records `null`: nobody knows what it started on, so it is never called
 * stale or renewed. A best-before date, printed on the carton, which the
 * carton is not allowed to argue with.
