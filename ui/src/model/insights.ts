/**
 * Insights on tickets (#253): what deserves a look about each work item, from
 * its OWI fields, its transitions, its links and the pull requests, builds and
 * deployments that name it. Pure, so the cards, the item page, the "needs
 * attention" list and the agent all say the same thing, and the tests check
 * it. Every insight says what it rests on (principle 4): the OWI field, the
 * history, or the toil command whose output showed it. One that the data
 * can't support (aging with fewer than three cycle times to compare against,
 * "built but not deployed" for a dossier that names no environment) isn't
 * raised at all, rather than raised on a guess.
 * The standup's "any blockers?", answered before anyone unmutes.
