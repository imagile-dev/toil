/**
 * "How sure is this?" under an answer (#552), worked out by code and never by
 * the model. Three plain checks over what the answer rested on: did every read
 * work, how old is the data, and how many of the items it used lack something
 * the question needs. High is all three clear, Medium is one that slipped,
 * Low is a read that failed, data over three days old, or too few items to go
 * on. The result is a word and one sentence that says why, so the level never
 * has to be taken on trust. A confidence score that shows its working, which
 * is more than the average forecast does.
 *
 * Pure: the same inputs give the same sentence, so the boundaries are tested
 * without a page.
