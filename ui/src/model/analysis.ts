/**
 * Analyze's answers, kept and compared (#395). An Analyze answer is written
 * top-down, in the Minto order the prompt asks for (server/agents/prompts.ts):
 * a Recommendation line, then at most three Issues, then the Evidence. This
 * module reads that shape back out of the text (`structureOf`), so the page
 * can lay it out and the history can keep the recommendation and issues on
 * their own. It also takes a small snapshot of the dossier at the moment of
 * each analysis (what is blocked and by what, each item's points, the
 * sprint's points done and left), so the history can say what changed from
 * one analysis to the next by code, never by asking the agent. Pure, so the
 * server, the sample and the page all use the same rules.
 *
 * An answer that doesn't follow the shape is kept and shown as it came, and
 * the page says it didn't follow it (principle 4): a model's slip is never
 * reshaped into something it didn't write. Minutes with an agenda, at last.
