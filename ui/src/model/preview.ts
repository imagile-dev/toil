/**
 * What a dossier's card on the Dossiers view says about the work (#342), from
 * the same data its dashboard reads (src/load.ts), which the local app answers
 * from the cache: no tracker is asked. Its sprint with the days left and a
 * small burn-up, how many items are in progress and blocked, how many pull
 * requests wait on a review, who is on it, and what changed since this
 * browser last opened its dashboard. The dashboard's header shows the same
 * counts, so the two can't disagree. A status report that writes itself, and
 * is therefore read.
