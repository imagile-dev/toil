/**
 * The seam Toil UI is built on (#206, #228): toil itself. Every panel is
 * filled by calling toil commands through `execute()` from
 * `@imagile-dev/toil/api`, read-only, which call the tools' REST APIs with the
 * user's own connections and dossiers. The UI holds no credential and talks to
 * no service on its own. The site preview passes a fixture `execute()`
 * (src/fixtures/execute.ts) with the same signature, which answers from canned,
 * sanitized envelopes; test/registry.test.ts holds every call it answers to the
 * real registry, and holds this type to the real `execute`'s.
 *
 * What toil's commands don't shape yet (pull requests, builds, deployments:
 * OWI 0.1 leaves them out) the UI reads from each command's own output into
 * the small shapes below (src/model/delivery.ts). One door, one key, and a
 * sign-in sheet that fills itself in.
