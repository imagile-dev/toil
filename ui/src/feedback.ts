/**
 * The Feedback dialog's seam (#265): `toil feedback`, run through the local
 * server's `api/feedback` (ui/server/server.ts), never by Toil UI calling
 * anyone itself. A preview is the command run read-only, so it sends nothing
 * and returns exactly the report it would send and the disclaimer; sending is
 * the same command again with the person's yes to its `consent` question,
 * which the page gives only while its checkbox is ticked for that exact
 * report. The text the dialog shows is the command's own, from the toil the
 * server runs, so the page has no copy of the disclaimer to drift.
 *
 * The site preview passes a fixture (src/fixtures/feedback.ts) that builds the
 * same report with toil's own code and sends nothing, saying so. The comment
 * card goes in the box; the box is locked until you sign the card.
