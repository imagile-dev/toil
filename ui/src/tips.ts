/**
 * Toil tips (#419): one line about toil or Toil UI on every loading screen,
 * the way a game's loading screen teaches while you wait. Every tip is a
 * real, checked fact in plain words, and carries a Read more link from the
 * help topics (src/help.ts), whose test resolves each link against the docs'
 * own headings, so a tip can't point at a section that isn't there.
 *
 * A theme frames a tip (its label, "Foreman's note", "Almanac entry"), never
 * words it: the text below reads the same in every theme, as a notification
 * does. The order is shuffled once per browser session, and a tip seen this
 * session isn't shown again until every one has been. Tips can be switched
 * off under Settings, General, and the choice is kept in this browser only.
 * The induction pack, read one line at a time while the kettle boils.
