/**
 * What the command palette (#416) asks of a view that owns the thing it acts
 * on: the Ask bar focuses itself, runs Analyze or answers with another agent,
 * and a dossier's page opens the Assign dialog for an item. The palette sits
 * above every view, so it can't call into one directly; it sends the request
 * here and the view that is showing picks it up. Nothing is queued: a request
 * no view is listening for is dropped, which is why the palette offers these
 * only on a dossier's pages. An internal memo, routed to whoever is at their desk.
