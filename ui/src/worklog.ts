 * preview and `toil-ui --sample` answer from the sample data
 * (src/fixtures/worklog.ts), keeping nothing.
 *
 * Export writes a page through toil's own file service, so a file lands only
 * inside the folder the person names and never in toil's config. Publishing
 * one anywhere is a proposal: the `toil … --allow-write` line for a person to
 * run through the write gate. Toil UI posts nothing. The out tray, emptied by
