/**
 * Wording (#283), split by what a person does with it (the maintainer's call,
 * 2026-11-05; CLAUDE.md, principle 11, and ui/docs/themes.md, Words).
 *
 * FUNCTIONAL keys are words a person reads to ACT or to find something by
 * name: an eyebrow that names the page, a field's placeholder, the status
 * line that says where a figure was read from and how long it took. They read
 * the one plain text in every theme. A theme's `lexicon` may not set one
 * (test/themes.test.ts), and `wordFor` ignores a theme's value for one, so a
 * script, a screen reader and voice control find the same name everywhere
 * (WCAG 2.5.3).
 *
 * FLAVOUR keys are words nothing depends on: a lede or an explanation under a
 * heading, an empty-state sentence, a loading or progress line. A theme's
 * `lexicon` may say these in its own voice, and the plain text is what shows
 * when a theme has none, in Plain, and with themed wording off. Flavour never
 * replaces a number, a command, an id, an error or its fix: a `{name}` and
 * every `toil ...` command in the plain text stays in the theme's text.
 *
 * To add a key, put it in `FUNCTIONAL` or in `FLAVOUR` below, whichever it is,
 * and add it to the lists in test/words-classification.test.ts, which exist
 * so that nobody decides by accident. A flavour key then gets a line in every
 * theme's `lexicon`. A not-found notice, a control's name, a command, a
 * number, a date and an error with its fix are never keys at all: they are
 * written where they are drawn, in plain words.
 *
 * The plain text is the one a person reads by default: everyday words, with
 * toil's own term one hover away (src/plain-words.ts). The standard wording,
 * filed in two folders so that the dialects can be audited separately.
