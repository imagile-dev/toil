/**
 * Themed wording (#283): the microcopy a game theme may say in its own words,
 * looked up by key with the standard text as the fallback, the way an i18n
 * catalogue works with one language and four dialects. A theme's `lexicon`
 * in `theme.json` replaces any of these; a key it leaves out, Plain, and
 * "Themed wording" switched off all read the standard text below.
 *
 * Only microcopy is here: eyebrows, ledes and notes, empty states, loading
 * lines. Never a not-found notice, such as an item the dossier doesn't have,
 * which says what went wrong in plain words. Never a control's name (a button, a link, a field's label), a
 * heading a test or a screen reader finds a region by, a command, an id, a
 * number, a date, an error or its fix: those read the same in every theme,
 * so what a person, a script or voice control looks for is always there
 * (WCAG 2.5.3). A `{name}` in the text is filled in from the view, and a
 * theme's wording must keep every one, and every `toil …` command, that the
 * standard text has (test/themes.test.ts).
 * The standard wording, approved once and translated into four dialects without a vote.
