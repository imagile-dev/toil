/**
 * The settings pages' seam (#253, item 4): toil's own config commands, run
 * through `execute()` from `@imagile-dev/toil/api` on the local server, never
 * by editing a file. This is the one place Toil UI changes anything, and only
 * toil's own configuration: its connections and dossiers. The server holds the
 * allowlist below (ui/server/config.ts) and runs nothing else on this path;
 * test/config.test.ts holds the list to the real registry.
 *
 * A change is an explicit action by the person at the page, so the commands
 * that ask a person questions on a terminal (`connections add`, `login`,
 * `writes`, ...) get them asked here instead: the page collects the answers
 * and the server hands them to toil as the call's `person`. A secret goes from
 * a password field to toil's login path, which keeps it in the OS credential
 * store. It is never kept by the page after the call, never logged, and never
 * sent back. Turning writes on needs the connection's name typed, exactly as
 * `toil connections writes <name> on` asks for it.
 *
 * The site preview passes a fixture (src/fixtures/config.ts) that reads sample
 * data and changes nothing, saying so. Paperwork about the paperwork, filed
 * where the paperwork is.
