/**
 * The board panel (#252, #347): the toil project's sprint in one column per OWI
 * status category, whatever tracker each item came from, with its source's
 * own status word, its assignee, its estimate and its insights on the card.
 * The whole card is the drag handle (dnd-kit): a mouse or pen after a few
 * pixels of movement, a finger after a short hold, the keyboard with Space or
 * Enter on the focused card. Its context menu (right-click, the Menu key,
 * a long press, or M while it has focus) is the single-pointer way to make
 * the same move, so no card carries a button for it.
 *
 * A drop is the person's own act, so with "Apply board moves when I drop a
 * card" on (the default, src/board-moves.ts) it makes the move: the card is in
 * its new column at once, quietly marked as moving, and the server asks toil
 * to change the status behind the connection's `writes` (ui/server/board.ts).
 * A move no command could make (a GitHub issue's In progress when the Toil
 * project names no project board, a board toil couldn't read, a closed pull
 * request asked to leave Done) is not a proposal: the card stays, no ghost is left, and
 * one notice says what is wrong and what to do (components/blocked-move.tsx),
 * until it is dismissed. The column that can't take the card in hand says so
 * while it is dragged.
 * It then says so with an Undo, which makes the reverse move the same way; if
 * toil refuses, the card goes back and the refusal stays on screen until
 * dismissed. Where the move can't be made for the person (the setting is off,
 * the sample, a connection with writes off, a status more than one transition
 * leads to, a card the app can't move) nothing changes in the tracker: the
 * move becomes a proposal card naming the toil command that would apply it
 * (src/model/board.ts), with one line saying why, and the card stays where
 * its tracker says it is.
 *
 * What a person sees (#393): while a card is dragged, a copy of it follows
 * the pointer (dnd-kit's DragOverlay, in a portal so no scrolling box clips
 * it) and says what a drop there would do; the card itself stays put as a
 * dashed placeholder; the column under the pointer is outlined as a target,
 * or as refused when the card is already in it. After a move that stays a
 * proposal, by drag, keyboard or menu, a ghost of the card sits at the top of
 * the target column, marked as a proposal not applied, with Undo and the way
 * to apply it.
