/**
 * A chart's full page, under the Summary (#567): `…/summary/<dashboard>`. The Charts tab is gone. Three of the
 * dashboards are items on the Summary (views/summary-charts.tsx), each a link to its page here; the others
 * (Releases, Sprints, Explore) are not offered there, and are reached by their own addresses and the command palette.
 * A dashboard is a module (charts/dashboard.ts); this file knows none of them by name. It is, in effect, a
 * door that opens whichever office the address names, and says so politely when there is none.
