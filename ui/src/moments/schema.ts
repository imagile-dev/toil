/**
 * Theme moments (#419): what a theme may declare in its `theme.json` under
 * `"moments"`, and the plain defaults a theme without the block gets. A theme
 * only declares; the one engine in this folder plays it (the splash, the
 * loading screens, the dossier entrance, the tab transitions and the event
 * moments), so no theme writes a player of its own.
 *
 * Everything a moment shows is named here as data: an asset by its key in the
 * theme's `assets`, a motion by its motif name from the fixed lists below, and
 * words as plain text. The engine's motifs move only `transform` and
 * `opacity` (src/moments/moments.css), so a theme can't ask for an animation
 * that repaints the page. Plain data with no imports, so the docs and the
 * tests can read it as it is.
 * The choreography is approved in advance and filed under "moments".
