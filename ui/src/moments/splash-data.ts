/**
 * What the launch splash may know before anything has loaded (#462). The
 * splash plays while the first read runs, so the sprint it would show hasn't
 * arrived yet; and it ends the moment that read is done, so it never sees it
 * arrive either. Instead this browser remembers, each time it loads a dossier,
 * the sprint that dossier was in: its name, its dates and the items done. The
 * next launch on that dossier's page works the day out from those dates at the
 * App's clock, the same way the dashboard does, so the splash and the page it
 * hands over to agree (but for a sprint's weekend start, which the page calls
 * day 0 and the splash day 1). Nothing is remembered on sample data.
 *
 * Kept in localStorage beside `toil-ui:looked` (src/looked.ts), per browser,
 * never sent anywhere. With nothing remembered, storage off, a sprint over or
 * not begun, or a dossier with no sprint, the splash is handed nothing and
 * looks as it always has. A forecast made from yesterday's weather, which is
 * still the most accurate one in the building.
