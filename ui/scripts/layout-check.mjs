// The layout check (#277): every Toil UI view, in every theme and scheme, at
// 375, 768 and 1440 pixels, in real headless Chrome. It fails on what a
// person would see as broken, whatever the theme:
//
//   - the page itself scrolling sideways;
//   - more than one <main> or app header in the document (a page left behind by a remount);
//   - any element whose content is wider than its box (scrollWidth more than
//     clientWidth + 1), unless it is a declared scroller (`data-scroller`,
//     which DataTable and the other scrollers carry with their cue and focus)
//     or a declared truncation (`data-truncate`, Path and Url, which keep the
//     whole value in a tooltip and a copy button);
//   - a child box reaching past the edge of its card (`data-card`);
//   - something fixed to the bottom of the screen covering the end of the
//     page once it is scrolled all the way down;
//   - a tab bar (`data-tabs-row`) that scrolls while a sibling takes more than a tenth of its row, or overlaps it;
//   - a row that must stay one row (`data-one-row`: the compact header, the
//     settings tabs) wrapping onto a second;
//   - the header folded into its Menu at 1440 pixels or wider, where every
//     theme's full row fits on the sample data (#387; `headerFits`, off for
//     real data, whose toil project names and links may genuinely fill the row);
//   - an open modal whose backdrop doesn't dim the page;
//   - and, in the strict themes (Plain and Crate, light and dark), any axe
//     violation at WCAG 2.2 AA. The other themes' axe findings are reported,
//     never failed (the maintainer's bar, AGENT_DECISIONS.md, #267).
//
// Each view is checked as it opens and with its hidden parts showing: every
// <details> open, each toil project card's Show pressed, the header menu and the
// Feedback dialog open, every toil project name and description open for editing, the Assign dialog open from an item and the inbox, the Agents
// drawer, the toil project switcher, a metric's full chart and the board's needs-attention filter (#394), the focused Ask view open
// from the Ask bar (#343) with its (i) popover, its agent switcher, an answer, its Suggestions menu and
// Analyze's pulse check, a help (i)'s tooltip and popover (#346), the Agent page's full prompt and its Install dialog shown (#344), a worklog day rebuilt and
// the calendar on an earlier month, a stand-up written up, and every failing
// command's recent audit lines open on the Usage page (the sample's; real data may have none), the bell's list and What's new (#417), and the theme moments' previews
// (#419): a loading screen, the launch splash and the sprint recap card. Reduced motion
// is on, so an animation caught mid-flight can't fail a run; `npm run smoke` then runs
// MOTION_ROUTES again with motion on, where the moments play.
//
// On a toil project's Board tab the board is also dragged as a hand drags it
// (#393): real mouse input through the DevTools protocol, a finger at 375
// pixels, with moves in between. Mid-drag the copy of the card must be under
// the pointer and the card itself still in its column; after the drop a
// proposed ghost must sit in the target column, and that state goes through
// the same layout and axe checks as the others. Scripted DOM events proved
// the drop and missed that nothing on screen moved.
//
// `npm run smoke -w ui` runs it against the installed package (`toil-ui
// --sample`). By hand, against any build:
//
//   npx vite preview --port 4173            (after `npx vite build`, in ui/)
//   node scripts/layout-check.mjs --base http://127.0.0.1:4173/ [--theme crate] [--route '#/settings/projects'] [--width 375] [--font <pair id>] [--motion full] [--shots <dir>] [--json <file>]
//
// Repo tooling only; nothing here ships. It measures twice and files once.
