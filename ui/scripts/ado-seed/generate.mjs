// Writes ui/scripts/ado-seed/items.owi.json: about 45 made-up work items for an
// Azure DevOps Services board (Scrum process), as Open Work Item 0.1 records,
// spread across the three sample dossiers' products (card-payments, settlement,
// checkout-web). The choices are random but seeded, so the same seed always
// writes the same file:
//
//   node ui/scripts/ado-seed/generate.mjs              # seed 319, the committed file
//   node ui/scripts/ado-seed/generate.mjs --seed 7 --out <file>
//   node ui/scripts/ado-seed/generate.mjs --check      # fail if the committed file is stale
//
// Every record is checked against docs/owi/schema.json before it is written.
// apply.mjs creates the items from this file; cleanup.mjs removes them again.
//
// What a record holds before the board has seen it:
//   - id is `toil-seed:<key>`, a connection name that is no real connection, and
//     parent, children and links point at other seed ids. apply.mjs keeps the
//     key on the work item it creates, and the id map it writes is how the two
//     are joined again.
//   - `@project` stands for the project, which is given to apply.mjs and is
//     never written here: the backlog is the iteration `@project`, a sprint
//     `@project\Sprint 1`. The sprints must exist; nothing here creates them.
//   - An assignee of `@Me` (WIQL's own macro) is the token's identity. No one
//     else is ever assigned.
//   - url, reporter, the dates and the history are the server's to give, so
//     they are null here; the timeline below is what apply.mjs asks it for.
//   - native["ado-seed generate"] carries what OWI has no field for: the type's
//     own extra fields (acceptance criteria, repro steps, severity, remaining
//     work), and its timeline: when it was created, and each state and sprint
//     it moved to on the way to its last one, drawn back from a fixed day
//     (ANCHOR) so the file doesn't change with the date it is generated on.
//
// Repo tooling only: nothing here ships. The roadmap was decided by a random
// number generator, which is at least a documented process.
