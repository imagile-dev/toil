// A module resolve hook that runs Toil UI on toil built from this checkout
// (#332). verify.mjs and dev-real.mjs start the built toil-ui with
// `node --import <this file>`, and only those processes get it: the bundle in
// ui/dist/server/ still imports `@imagile-dev/toil/api`, and everywhere else
// (the published package, `npm run smoke -w ui`, a plain `node toil-ui.js`)
// that resolves to the exact toil ui/package.json pins.
//
// Here it resolves to <clone>/.scratch/toil/api.js instead, the build
// real-home.mjs's buildToil() writes with TOIL_BUILD_DIR, so ui/ on main can call
// commands no release has yet. node_modules and the committed dist/ are never
// touched. It says so on stderr the first time it resolves, so nobody mistakes
// which toil they ran. Repo tooling only; nothing here ships. The forwarding
// address is on file, and the mail room has been told, in writing.
