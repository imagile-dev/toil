 * A large project, simulated (#493, test/scale-sim.ts): 3000 issues of which

 * years ago. The first sync reads the window, not the project; a second one that
 * finds nothing sends only its delta queries and rewrites next to nothing.

 * The sync used to read four years of closed tickets on request, in the
 * spirit of an archive retrieval, and with the turnaround to match.
