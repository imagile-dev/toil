## [0.1.0-beta.3](https://github.com/imagile-dev/toil/compare/v0.1.0-beta.2...v0.1.0-beta.3) (2026-10-29)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* the ado-cloud area is gone, with no deprecation period. The contract version is 2 for this release, the same bump the Jira fold makes. Migrate as follows:
    - Config: a version 1 or 2 file loads as it is; a connection with "area":
      "ado-cloud" is read as "area": "ado", "deployment": "cloud", and
      defaults.ado-cloud folds into defaults.ado (ado's default connection wins,
      with a warning naming the one dropped; defaults.ado's shared keys are written
      onto existing Server connections instead of reaching Services ones). Commands
      that save config write version 3. Keychain entries are untouched.
    - Commands: `toil ado-cloud ...` is `toil ado ...` (use --connection, or make the
      Services connection the default). The old path fails with INVALID_INPUT naming
      the new form.
    - MCP: ado_cloud_* tools are ado_*, and `toil mcp --areas ado-cloud` is
      `--areas ado`.
    - Env vars: TOIL_ADO_CLOUD_* is refused with CONFIG_INVALID; set TOIL_ADO_*
      with TOIL_ADO_DEPLOYMENT=cloud (or TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_* with
      TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_AREA=ado and TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_DEPLOYMENT=cloud). In an Azure
      Pipelines step, set TOIL_ADO_DEPLOYMENT: cloud beside TOIL_ADO_PAT and
      TOIL_ADO_BASE_URL. SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN is read for a Server default only.
    - Dossiers: rename an ado-cloud section to ado (transition pins are
      ado.transitions). It is read as ado with a warning until you do, and ado wins
      when both exist.
    - Warning codes: ADO_CLOUD_WORK_ITEMS_MISSING, ADO_CLOUD_TYPE_UNKNOWN and
      ADO_CLOUD_DEFAULT_TEAM are ADO_WORK_ITEMS_MISSING, ADO_TYPE_UNKNOWN and
      ADO_DEFAULT_TEAM.
    - Flags: ado pr list takes --creator <id> and --reviewer <id> (the value was
      always an identity id).
* the bitbucket-cloud area is gone, with no deprecation period. Migrate as follows:
    - Config: a version 1 or 2 file loads as it is; a connection with "area":
      "bitbucket-cloud" is read as "area": "bitbucket", "deployment": "cloud", and
      defaults.bitbucket-cloud folds into defaults.bitbucket (bitbucket's default
      connection wins, with a warning naming the one dropped). Commands that save
      config write version 3. Keychain entries are untouched.
    - Commands: `toil bitbucket-cloud ...` is `toil bitbucket ...` (use
      --connection, or make the Cloud connection the default). The old path fails
      with INVALID_INPUT naming the new form. `pr request-changes` is an alias of
      `pr needs-work`.
    - MCP: bitbucket_cloud_* tools are bitbucket_* (bitbucket_cloud_pr_request_changes
      is bitbucket_pr_needs_work), and `toil mcp --areas bitbucket-cloud` is
      `--areas bitbucket`.
    - Env vars: TOIL_BITBUCKET_CLOUD_* is refused with CONFIG_INVALID; set
      TOIL_BITBUCKET_* with TOIL_BITBUCKET_DEPLOYMENT=cloud (or TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_*
      with TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_AREA=bitbucket and TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_DEPLOYMENT=cloud).
      A Bitbucket Pipelines step also needs TOIL_BITBUCKET_DEPLOYMENT=cloud.
    - Dossiers: rename a bitbucket-cloud section to bitbucket. It is read as
      bitbucket with a warning until you do, and bitbucket wins when both exist.
    - Flags: Cloud's --reviewers placeholder is <users>, and repo create's
      --project is the shared project input.
* the confluence-cloud area is gone, with no deprecation period. Migrate as follows.
    - Config: a connection with "area": "confluence-cloud" is read as "area":
      "confluence", "deployment": "cloud", and defaults.confluence-cloud folds into
      defaults.confluence. Any toil connections change writes the file back with the
      new form. Keychain entries are untouched.
    - Commands and tools: toil confluence-cloud ... is toil confluence ...,
      confluence_cloud_* tools are confluence_*, and --areas confluence-cloud is
      --areas confluence. The old forms fail with INVALID_INPUT naming the new one.
    - Env vars: TOIL_CONFLUENCE_CLOUD_* is refused with CONFIG_INVALID. Use
      TOIL_CONFLUENCE_* with TOIL_CONFLUENCE_DEPLOYMENT=cloud, or TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_*
      with TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_AREA=confluence and TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_DEPLOYMENT=cloud.
      TOIL_CONFLUENCE_* values on a default connection that is Cloud are refused
      unless TOIL_CONFLUENCE_DEPLOYMENT is set.
    - Dossiers: a confluence-cloud section is read as confluence, with a
      DOSSIER_RENAMED_AREA warning. A dossier has one confluence section.
* the jira-cloud area is gone, with no deprecation period, and the contract version is 2. Migrate as follows:
    - Config: a version 2 file loads as it is; a connection with "area":
      "jira-cloud" is read as "area": "jira", "deployment": "cloud", and
      defaults.jira-cloud folds into defaults.jira (jira's default connection wins,
      with a warning naming the one dropped). Commands that save config write
      version 3. Keychain entries are untouched.
    - Commands: `toil jira-cloud …` is `toil jira …` (use --connection, or make the
      Cloud connection the default). The old path fails with INVALID_INPUT naming the
      new form.
    - MCP: jira_cloud_* tools are jira_*, and `toil mcp --areas jira-cloud` is
      `--areas jira`.
    - Env vars: TOIL_JIRA_CLOUD_* is refused with CONFIG_INVALID; set TOIL_JIRA_*
      with TOIL_JIRA_DEPLOYMENT=cloud (or TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_* with
      TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_AREA=jira and TOIL_CONN_<NAME>_DEPLOYMENT=cloud).
    - Dossiers: rename a jira-cloud section to jira. It is read as jira with a
      warning until you do, and jira wins when both exist.
    - jira issue schema takes --deployment cloud for the Cloud input file shape.
