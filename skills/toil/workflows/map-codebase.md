# Map a codebase

Rules every page shares: `workflows/README.md`. The result is a map of a repository, a
C4 diagram built from it, and a file that keeps both. The map is built from
what commands return, never from reading every file. Onboarding someone is this page,
then `toil dossiers brief` and how to run the repository's gate; it needs no page of its own.

## Steps

The repository is the workspace: run from it, or pass `--workspace <repo>` before the
command. Every file toil reads or writes, the model and the diagrams included, has to be
inside the workspace.

1. **Map.** Gather facts, each remembered with the file and line or the command it
   came from.

   ```bash
   toil util size . --depth 2 --top 20
   toil util size <source-folder> --top 20
   toil util size <one-of-the-largest-source-files>
   toil util deps scan
   toil git log --count 200 --since "3 months ago"
   toil dossiers show
   toil util openapi list <spec-file>
   ```

   - **Tree and sizes.** `util size .` shows the folders. Its largest files will often be
     generated bundles, lockfiles and images; leave those, and any vendored or
     generated folder, in `notMapped`. Run `util size` again on the source folders (the
     manifests from `deps scan` and the tree say which) to find the largest source files,
     then read the outline (functions, classes, line ranges) of those one at a time,
     and only the parts you need.
   - **Entry points and packages.** `deps scan` returns `manifests` (each with its
     `file`, `ecosystem` and `lockFile`): read those for entry points and which
     packages live where. Its `packages` list can run to thousands, so select from it
     rather than reading it (`--select "manifests[].file"`).
   - **Edges.** A code file's outline lists its imports (`util size <file> --select
     outline.imports`; each is `{ specifier, kind, line }`, as written and never
     resolved). Run that over a module's source files (it is toil's command, not reading
     every file) and fold each specifier into a module yourself: a relative specifier
     (`../core/x.js`) resolves against the importing file's folder and lands in the
     module whose path holds it; a package specifier names a package. For C# and .NET,
     the `.csproj` `ProjectReference` lines are the module edges and `using` imports
     confirm them. A module's dependents are the other modules with an edge into it.
     For a language with no outline, use manifests and folders.
   - **What changes.** `git log` lists commits and no files, so a hot spot read from the
     scope in each commit message is inferred, and commits without a scope are counted
     as unscoped. If `--since` returns nothing, widen the window or drop it.
   - **Around the repository.** `dossiers show` answering "No dossier applies" is
     normal: note that none applies and move on. Run `util openapi list` only for
     specs the tree has.
   - **Recorded reasoning.** Read the repository's ADRs and decision files
     (`docs/adr/`, `docs/decisions/`), and link each to the modules it names.

   Group modules by their real boundaries: packages, manifests, top-level folders.
   Don't group by guess.

2. **Model.** Build or refresh a C4 model (context, containers, and components where
   they are clear) from the map and the dossier. Add runtime facts only where they are
   connected:

   ```bash
   toil dynatrace service list
   toil openshift deployment list
   toil artifactory build list
   ```

   The model's format is in `util.md`, **toil util c4**. A map module and its model
   element share one id. Every element and every relationship is either **observed**
   (read from source or a command; put the file and line or the command in its
   `description`) or **inferred** (your reading; begin the `description` with
   `(inferred)` and the reason). The model has no field for it yet, so the diagram
   shows it that way and nobody takes a guess for a fact. In a components view, a
   relationship must start and end at elements inside the boundary, or `util c4` drops
   it with `C4_RELATIONSHIP_NOT_DRAWN`. Find the **hubs**: the modules most others
   depend on, and the ones most often changed together, so a reader knows where
   everything flows and where to start.

3. **Draw and place.** One view at a time.

   ```bash
   toil util c4 render <model.json> --view containers --out <new-file>.svg
   toil util c4 mermaid <model.json> --view context --select text
   toil util c4 d2 <model.json> --view components
   ```

   `render --out` never overwrites a file, so a refresh needs a new name, and the
   file has to be inside the workspace. `mermaid` with `--select text` returns the
   Mermaid text itself as `data`. Propose where the map goes and write it only on the
   person's yes: a folder of the repository (`docs/`, where Mermaid draws inline on
   GitHub), or a Confluence page. If the repository shouldn't hold it, keep the model
   and diagrams in another folder and pass that as `--workspace` for the `c4`
   commands. For Confluence, Data Center takes
   `toil confluence page update <id> --body-file <file> --markdown --allow-write`;
   Cloud takes storage format, from `toil util md <file> --to storage`, saved and sent as
   `--body-file`. Attach the SVG with `toil confluence page attach <id> --file <svg> --allow-write`.

4. **Keep the map.** Write one JSON file at a path the person picks, inside the
   repository or the workspace they chose (propose `docs/map/map.json`, with the
   model beside it), with the agent's own file tools:

   ```json
   { "schemaVersion": 1, "toilVersion": "<toil version>", "commit": "<repository sha mapped>",
     "modules": [{ "id": "core", "path": "src/core", "how": "observed", "source": "package.json" }],
     "edges": [{ "from": "cli", "to": "core", "how": "inferred", "reason": "folder naming" }],
     "hubs": [{ "id": "core", "dependents": 12, "changedWith": ["cli"],
                "changedWithHow": "inferred", "changedWithReason": "commit scopes" }],
     "decisions": [{ "file": "docs/decisions/12-x.md", "modules": ["core"] }],
     "notMapped": ["dist/", "vendored/"], "c4": { "model": "docs/map/model.json" } }
   ```

   - Module ids are the model's element ids, and `edges`, `hubs` and `decisions` use
     only those ids. `changedWith` holds module ids and nothing else; when it was read
     from commit scopes, say so in `changedWithHow` and `changedWithReason`.
     `decisions[].modules` may be empty.
   - `<toil version>` is `toil version`. `commit` is the **repository's** head at the
     mapping, from `toil git log --count 1` (not the commit `toil version` prints, which
     is toil's own build).
   - A module's `path` may list several paths, and `how` and its `source` or `reason`
     follow the observed or inferred rule above.

   **Refresh.** A later run reads the file instead of the code, then updates only what
   changed:

   1. List the changed files with your own git: `git diff --name-only <commit> HEAD`
      (toil's `git diff` shows only staged or working changes).
   2. Map each path to its module by path prefix; a path no module holds is new
      (add a module) or belongs in `notMapped`.
   3. Re-scan imports only for changed source files, update those modules' edges, and
      recompute the hubs.
   4. Render the diagrams again under new names, since `--out` never overwrites, and
      record the new `commit`.

   Answer questions from the file rather than the code. `--select` works on a toil
   command's output, not on a file, so query the file with your own tools.

## Done when

The person has the diagram or has chosen where it goes, the map file is written where
they said, and the report says what was not mapped.

## Report

1. The map in a few lines: modules, hubs, entry points.
2. How much of it is observed and how much inferred, and the commit it describes.
3. What wasn't mapped: generated code, vendored folders, languages `util size` has no
   outline for.
4. Three questions worth asking next, each answerable from the map.

## Never

- Read every file, or present an inference as observed.
- Overwrite a diagram or the person's file without asking, or write to Confluence
  without a yes.
- Parse with anything but toil's commands and your own reading: no new dependency.
- Map folders you were not pointed at, or send repository contents anywhere.
